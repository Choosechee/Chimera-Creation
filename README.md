# Chimera Creation
  ## About the Mod
  For more information on the mod itself, look at the Steam Workshop page: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3331963520
  ## Future of the Mod
  This mod is planned to add a way to obtain friendly versions of all Anomaly entities. The next entity planned is the Devourer. When this update happens, the mod will change its name to "Anomaly Allies". Before that update, however, I want to add more prosthetics for friendly chimeras, along with some other stuff.
  ## How You Can Help
  I probably will not accept any implementations of friendly entities, unless you're on the same wavelength as me and create something similar to what I had in mind. I am happy to receive any translations, though!
